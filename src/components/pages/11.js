        It would never have occurred to Stormgren, even a few days before, that he could seriously have considered the action he was planning now. Sheer curiosity was also a powerful motive.

        Pierre Duval showed no surprise when Stormgren walked unannounced into his office. They were old friends and there was nothing unusual in the Secretary-General paying a personal visit to the Chief of the Science Bureau. Certainly Karellen would not think it odd, if by any chance he—or one of his underlings—turned his instruments of surveillance upon this spot.

        For a while the two men talked business and exchanged political gossip; then, rather hesitantly, Stormgren came to the point. As his visitor talked, the old Frenchman leaned back in his chair and his eyebrows rose steadily, millimeter by millimeter, until they were almost entangled in his forelock. Once or twice he seemed about to speak, but each time thought better of it.
