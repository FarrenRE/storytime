      <h1>7: To reveal an Overlord</h1>
      <p>
        One month later, Stormgren received a memo requesting his presence in the Chief of the Science Bureau’s office. He hastily informed his secretary of his departure and descended into the bowels of the United Nations Headquarters where Pierre Duval was waiting for him.

      <p>
        Restraining his excitement, Stormgren sat patiently while Duval touted his newest invention. Duval theorised that the vision screen in Karellen’s communications room was, rather, a window. Despite its name, he explained, there is no such thing as truly one-way glass. It’s simply a matter of arranging the lights, and Stormgren was going to change that.

        With the air of a conjurer producing a whole litter of white rabbits, he reached into his desk and pulled out an overgrown flashlight. The end flared out into a wide nozzle, so that the whole device looked rather like a blunderbuss.

        Stormgren looked at the weapon doubtfully and hefted it in his hand. For the last few weeks his conscience had been pricking him. Karellen had always treated him with unmistakable affection, despite his occasional devastating frankness, and now that their time together was drawing to its close he did not wish to do anything that might spoil that relationship. But the Supervisor had received due warning, and Stormgren had the conviction that if the choice had been his, Karellen would long ago have shown himself.

      <p>
      Now the decision would be made for him: when their last meeting came to its end, Stormgren would gaze upon Karellen’s face.
      </p>
      <p>
        If, of course, Karellen had a face.
