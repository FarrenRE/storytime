        The nervousness that Stormgren had first felt had long since passed away. Karellen was doing almost all the talking, weaving the intricate sentences which he was prone to use.

Now it no longer appeared quite so marvelous, for he knew that like most of the Supervisor’s abilities it was the result of sheer intellectual power and not of any special talent.
