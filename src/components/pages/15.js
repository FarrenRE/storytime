        The pine trees came almost to the edge of the lake, leaving along its border only a narrow strip of grass a few meters wide. Every evening when it was warm enough Stormgren, despite his ninety years, would walk briskly along this strip to the landing stage, watch the sunlight die upon the water, and then return to the house before the chill night wind came up from the forest. The simple ritual gave him much contentment, and he would continue it as long as he had the strength.

      Twenty years to go. Yes, Karellen had been right. By then the world would be ready, as it had not been when he had spoken that same lie to Duval thirty years ago.

It was the final proof, Stormgren knew, of Karellen’s affection for him.
