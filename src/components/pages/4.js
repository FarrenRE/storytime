      <h1>3: Five years later</h1>
      <p>
        The Secretary-General of the United Nations stood motionless by the great window, staring down at the crawling traffic on 43rd Street. He sometimes wondered if it was a good thing for any man to work at such an altitude above his fellow humans. Detachment was all very well, but it could change so easily to indifference. Or was he merely trying to rationalize his dislike of skyscrapers, still unabated after twenty years in New York?

      <p>
        Half a mile away, a small but determined crowd was moving slowly toward the Secretariat Building. It carried banners that were indecipherable at this distance, but Stormgren knew their message well enough. Presently he could hear, rising above the sound of the traffic, the ominous rhythm of chanting voices. He felt a sudden wave of disgust sweep over him. Surely the world had had enough of marching mobs and angry slogans!
      </p>
      <p>
      The crowd had now come abreast of the building; it must know that he was watching, for here and there fists were being shaken, rather self-consciously, in the air.

        They were not defying him, though the gesture was doubtless meant for Stormgren to see. As pygmies may threaten a giant, so those angry fists were directed against the sky fifty kilometers above his head—against the gleaming silver cloud that was the flagship of the Overlord fleet. And very probably, thought Stormgren, Karellen was watching the whole thing and enjoying himself hugely, for this meeting would never have taken place except at the Supervisor’s instigation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Karellen’s plans were often too subtle for merely human understanding. At the worst, Stormgren did not see that any harm could be done. If he had refused to see Wainwright, the league would have used the fact as ammunition against him. Alexander Wainwright was a tall, handsome man in his late forties. He was, Stormgren knew, completely honest, and therefore doubly dangerous. Yet his obvious sincerity made it hard to dislike him, whatever views one might have about the cause for which he stood—and about some of the followers he had attracted. Stormgren wasted no time after a brief and somewhat strained introductions.
