        Karellen never kept him waiting for long. There was a sudden “Oh!” from the crowd, and a silver bubble expanded with breath-taking speed in the sky above. The tiny ship came to rest fifty meters away, floating delicately a few centimeters above the ground. As he walked slowly forward, Stormgren saw that familiar puckering of the seamless metallic hull, and in a moment the opening that had so baffled the world’s best scientists appeared before him. He stepped through it into the ship’s single, softly-lit room. The entrance sealed itself as if it had never been, shutting out all sound and sight.
